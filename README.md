# Weather App
WeatherApp is a app that you can search for a city in the world and visualize the city's weather info in real time.

After you write the city you have chosen you click Enter and the info is going to emerge.

One different feature that I like is that you are able to save the cities by your choice.<br>
When you click the button +Add, the icon will pop up.

When you click the icon all the cities chosen will be there.
